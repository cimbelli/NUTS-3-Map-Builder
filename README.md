# NUTS-3 Map Builder
NUTS-3 Map Builder is a streamlined tool designed to transform regional datasets into high-quality, publication-ready maps. By uploading a CSV or Excel file containing NUTS-3 territorial codes and numerical indicators, users can instantly visualize their data across all European regions at the NUTS-3 administrative level.

The tool automatically detects the geographic scope, validates NUTS-3 codes, and merges the dataset with the corresponding European boundary files. Users can fully customize their map through multiple classification methods (quantiles, equal intervals, standard deviation, Fisher-Jenks, or manual breaks), ColorBrewer palettes, labels, and basemaps. The generator produces detailed, high-resolution choropleth maps suitable for reports, academic publications, dashboards, or policy analysis.

Final outputs are available for download in PDF, PNG, and JPG formats, ensuring maximum compatibility with presentations and documentation.
